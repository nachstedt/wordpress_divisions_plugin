Create multiple divisions in your site with individual menus, sidebars and header.
== Description ==

The Divisions Plugin enables you to create parts, called divisions, of your
web page with an individual look and feel as determined by individual sidebars,
navigation menus and header images. At the same time, all divisions share the
same content data and a single posts can be displayed in any division.
Navigation menu entries are used to switch between divisions.

Technically, the division is just determined by an additional argument in the
URL. Be aware that as of now, there is no check to prevent certain content to
be displayed in a given division. It is really just about the look and feel.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of the plugin archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or alternatively use the automatic installer)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. Overview of divisions in your web page.

2. Edit screen for a division: Choose which navigation menus and sidebars to
replace and decide whether the division should replace the header image in your
theme.

3. Replaced sidebars are populated with widgets just as the normal ones in the
widgets screen of the Appearance settings.

4. Menu items can be configured such as to modify the current division.

5. Replaced navigation menu locations are populated with menu instances just
as normal locations.
